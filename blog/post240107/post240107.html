Though we've parted ways with Falcor, who's found a new home on a hobby farm, and cherished Sancho's last days by the coast, their memories remain a comforting presence in our journey. Surrounded by boxes and the essentials, we're making do, learning to live with less, and finding joy in the simplicity of camper living.</div>
